title: What? Why?
---

I assume you might have asked yourself this question, but I’m grappling with the same thing. Why have a website? And why this particular website.

I envision this space being more home than display case. A little bit broader than just a portfolio. More personal than professional.

It’s definitely a place to display work. I’m not sure how filmmakers showed clients their work in the pre-internet age (I guess a VHS with ‘My Work’ scribbled in sharpie on the label) but this website seeks to replace that. 

It also functions, more generally, as a evidence of existence and… competence? I think in 2016 it’s fair to say that as a person in a creative field, a website is the proof that you’re a serious working person. ‘If you don’t have a website, you don’t exist,’ many serious people have said to me. Well, I have a website ergo sum.

And thirdly, this website is something I made (mostly) by hand. I designed it, I wrote a fair amount of the HTML, CSS and javascript, I’m hosting it on my own hosting. I decided for New Years that I was going to make myself a present, and this website is that. A present to myself. For me. So, I’m not going to necessarily apologize for it, but I do acknowledge that the tone is definitely different than that of other spaces on the web.

Whatever, I’m a little different than other spaces on the web. 

So yeah, welcome to my space. Drop in once in awhile and see what I’m up to. Enjoy yourself and explore and see what you find. 

Oh!

### Why does this post exist?
That’s another good question. 

It mostly exists so when someone comes here and they’re like, ‘what are you doing?’, I can direct them to this post and say ‘this.’

I think it’ll work.
